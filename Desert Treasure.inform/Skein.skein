Desert
The sands of the desert irritates your eyes as you look around. The entire desert is silent, and the only thing you can hear are your own heat-beat and the sound of your own breathing. It&apos;s freezing cold right now since blazing desert sun has set beyond the horizon. The Pyramid that holds the legendary Eye of Horus is stands before you, glowing with an eerie light.

The dark hallway is covered in dozens of various depictions of Ancient Egyptian art depicing the life of the Pharoah and his Queen. It is slightly stuffy here, no doubt due the amount of time that this tomb has been sealed away.

Your flashlight sputters and dies. You shake it before you realize that it is really dead before throwing it away in disgust. Thankfully you lit the torch before you came in so you have some lighting.

The Hall is filled with adornments, praising the Queen entombed here. There is a ornate door to the north and the Main hall is to the west.
 &quot;I warned you to leave.&quot; the voice growls again. It is then that you realize that the voice is coming from the Jackal! 
 &quot;Why are you still here?&quot; he asks menacingly, slowly getting closer to you. Maybe you should try talk to him…

You can see a Silver Door, a Queen&apos;s Door, and a Large Black Jackal here.

The jackal glares at you. &quot;I&apos;m not eating that. I live off of the energies of the temple. I don&apos;t need to eat anything.&quot; But something tells you that he appreciated the offer.

The main hall is a wonderous location, the walls rich with dozens of hieroglyphs as well as various pictures of the King and Queen as they adorn the walls. It shows their triumphs as they ruled their kingdom with a strange artifact in hand. It is a large jewel with gold decorations. It looks very important.

You can see a Large Black Jackal here.
