Entrance
The hallway is covered in dozens of various depictions of Ancient Egyptian art depicing the life of the Pharoah and his Queen. It is slightly stuffy here, no doubt due the amount of time that this tomb has been sealed away.

You can see a Torch here.

Main hall
The main hall is a wonderous location, the walls rich with dozens of hieroglyphs as well as various pictures of the King and Queen as they adorn the walls. It shows their triumphs as they ruled their kingdom with a strange artifact in hand. It is a large jewel with gold decorations. It looks very important. A foutain of glittering water lies in the center of the room.

You can see a Queen&apos;s Door and a King&apos;s Door here.

Your flashlight sputters and dies. You shake it before you realize that it is really dead before throwing it away in disgust.

 &quot;I warned you to leave.&quot; the voice growls again. It is then that you realize that the voice is coming from the Jackal! 
 &quot;Why are you still here?&quot; he asks menacingly, slowly getting closer to you. Maybe you should try talk to him…

Main hall
The main hall is a wonderous location, the walls rich with dozens of hieroglyphs as well as various pictures of the King and Queen as they adorn the walls. It shows their triumphs as they ruled their kingdom with a strange artifact in hand. It is a large jewel with gold decorations. It looks very important.
