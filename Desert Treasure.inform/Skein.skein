The hallway is bare of deecorations. It is slightly stuffy here, no doubt due the amount of time that this place has been sealed away.

Main hall
The main hall is a wonderous location, the walls rich with dozens of hieroglyphs as well as various pictures of the King and Queen as they adorn the walls. It shows their triumphs as they ruled their kingdom with a strange artifact in hand. A large diamond set in a frame of gold and sapphire. A fountain of glittering water lies in the center of the room. The treasury is to the North, the Queen&apos;s door is to the East, the Stone door is to the south, and the King&apos;s door is to the West.

You can see a Queen&apos;s Door, a King&apos;s Door, an Ornate Door, and a Stone Door here.

Your flashlight sputters and dies. You shake it before you realize that it is really dead before throwing it away in disgust.  
It is now pitch dark in here!

You look around desperately before you realize something is on your wrist, A gold, silver, and sapphire bracelet with an large diamond in the center. 

&quot;The Eye has chosen a new wielder.&quot; Anubis says with reverence, &quot;I had suspected that there was something special about you, my lord.&quot; he bows, &quot;My body and soul are yours to command.&quot; Vitality wells through your body like a river, and you grin. 

&quot;Let&apos;s leave this place, Anubis,&quot; you say as both you and your companion vanish with but a thought with your newfound powers. A new world awaits you and your new guardian.

Entrance
The hallway is bare of deecorations. It is slightly stuffy here, no doubt due the amount of time that this place has been sealed away.

You slowly open the door with apprehension on your face.

Treasury
The Treasury is filled with various treasures of different sizes. All of Egypt&apos;s wealth is here. In the center of the room is a bejeweled stand with a diamond set in in a gold, silver, and sapphire frame. It glows with a mysterious power.

 &quot;Behold.&quot; the Jackal states, &quot;The Eye of Horus, the greatest treasure in all of Egypt.&quot;

On Jeweled Stand is Eye of Horus.

You can also see an Ornate Door and a Large Black Jackal here.

You look around desperately before you realize something is on your wrist, A gold, silver, and sapphire bracelet with an large diamond in the center. 

&quot;The Eye has chosen a new wielder.&quot; Anubis says with reverence, &quot;I had suspected that there was something special about you, my lord.&quot; he bows, &quot;My body and soul are yours to command.&quot; Vitality wells through your body like a river, and you grin. 

&quot;Let&apos;s leave this place, Anubis,&quot; you say as both you and your companion vanish with but a thought with your newfound powers. A new world awaits you and your new guardian.

You marvel at the scenery that is displayed before you. You somehow managed to find an Ancient Egyptian Tomb in the middle of nowhere! Since you cannot leave, you might as well explore the area. Those walls look interesting. 

That is before your flashlight sputters and dies. You shake it before you realize that it is really dead before throwing it away in disgust. Thankfully you lit the torch before you came in so you have some lighting.

You are startled by the sudden noise as you look around for where the voice came from. You manage to see a shadowy figure enter the door on the east.

You marvel at the scenery that is displayed before you. You somehow managed to find an Ancient Egyptian Tomb in the middle of nowhere! Since you cannot leave, you might as well explore the area. Those walls look interesting. 

That is before your flashlight sputters and dies. You shake it before you realize that it is really dead before throwing it away in disgust. Thankfully you lit the torch before you came in so you have some lighting.

Main hall
The main hall is a wonderous location, the walls rich with dozens of hieroglyphs as well as various pictures of the King and Queen as they adorn the walls. It shows their triumphs as they ruled their kingdom with a strange artifact in hand. It is a large jewel with gold decorations. It looks very important.

    <result xml:space="preserve">The wall slides open, revealing a hidden passageway. The Jackal quickly descends into the dark tunnel as you follow after him. When you finally reach the end, you find yourself back into the Main Hall as the passageway closes behind you. 

 The Jackal nods towards the entrance to the King&apos;s door. &quot;All that is left is to lock them in the room. There is not that many things of value in there, thankfully. I managed to take the mirror with me before I left.&quot;

Main hall
The main hall is a wonderous location, the walls rich with dozens of hieroglyphs as well as various pictures of the King and Queen as they adorn the walls. It shows their triumphs as they ruled their kingdom with a strange artifact in hand. It is a large jewel with gold decorations. It looks very important. A foutain of glittering water lies in the center of the room.

You can see a Queen&apos;s Door, a King&apos;s Door, and an Ornate Door here.

Treasury
A room filled with various treasures. All of Egypt&apos;s wealth is here. In the center of the room is a bejeweled pedestal with a diamond set in gold, silver, and lapis-lazuli. It glows with a mysterious power.

 &quot;Behold.&quot; the Jackal states, &quot;The Eye of Horus, the greatest treasure in all of Egypt.&quot;

On Jeweled Stand is Eye of Horus.

You flinch at the bright sunlight and when your eyes have adjusted you find yourself on the outskirts of Cairo. Glancing back at desert you frown. You feel something heavy in your pocket. You reach down and find a hefty amount of Gold and Silver along with a note: 

 Child of Man, may your life be filled with blessings.

Main hall
The main hall is a wonderous location, the walls rich with dozens of hieroglyphs as well as various pictures of the King and Queen as they adorn the walls. It shows their triumphs as they ruled their kingdom with a strange artifact in hand. It is a large jewel with gold decorations. It looks very important.

You can see a Queen&apos;s Door, a King&apos;s Door, and a Large Black Jackal here.
