Entrance
The hallway is bare of deecorations. It is slightly stuffy here, no doubt due the amount of time that this place has been sealed away.

You can see a Stone Door, Brass Key, and a Torch here.

Main hall
The main hall is a wonderous location, the walls rich with dozens of hieroglyphs as well as various pictures of the King and Queen as they adorn the walls. It shows their triumphs as they ruled their kingdom with a strange artifact in hand. A large diamond set in a frame of gold and sapphire. A fountain of glittering water lies in the center of the room. The treasury is to the North, the Queen&apos;s door is to the East, the Stone door is to the south, and the King&apos;s door is to the West.

You can see a Queen&apos;s Door, a King&apos;s Door, an Ornate Door, and a Stone Door here.

Your flashlight sputters and dies. You shake it before you realize that it is really dead before throwing it away in disgust.  
It is now pitch dark in here!

 &quot;I warned you to leave.&quot; the voice growls again. It is then that you realize that the voice is coming from the Jackal!

    <result xml:space="preserve">You take hold of the Eye as you feel power rush through your body. It feels like your mind and soul are about to burst. Anubis cries out in alarm, concerned about your well-being. But the sensation fades and when you open your eyes, the Eye is gone! 

You look around desperately before you realize something is on your wrist, A gold, silver, and sapphire bracelet with an large diamond in the center. 

&quot;The Eye has chosen a new wielder.&quot; Anubis says with reverence, &quot;I had suspected that there was something special about you, my lord.&quot; he bows, &quot;My body and soul are yours to command.&quot; Vitality wells through your body like a river, and you grin. 

&quot;Let&apos;s leave this place, Anubis,&quot; you say as both you and your companion vanish with but a thought with your newfound powers. A new world awaits you and your new guardian.

The hallway is bare of deecorations. It is slightly stuffy here, no doubt due the amount of time that this place has been sealed away.

Main hall
The main hall is a wonderous location, the walls rich with dozens of hieroglyphs as well as various pictures of the King and Queen as they adorn the walls. It shows their triumphs as they ruled their kingdom with a strange artifact in hand. A large diamond set in a frame of gold and sapphire. A fountain of glittering water lies in the center of the room.

You can see a Queen&apos;s Door, a King&apos;s Door, an Ornate Door, and a Stone Door here.

Treasury
A room filled with various treasures. All of Egypt&apos;s wealth is here. In the center of the room is a bejeweled pedestal with a diamond set in gold, silver, and lapis-lazuli. It glows with a mysterious power.

 &quot;Behold.&quot; the Jackal states, &quot;The Eye of Horus, the greatest treasure in all of Egypt.&quot;

On Jeweled Stand is Eye of Horus.

You can also see an Ornate Door and a Large Black Jackal here.

&quot;Well done,&quot; the Jackal comments, &quot;Your task is done and the storm has vanished. You may finally leave this place.&quot; he nods at you before he walks into the shadows. &quot;Farewell, and may we meet again.&quot; In a flash of light you find yourself out of the tomb and back in the desert. You flinch at the bright sunlight and when your eyes have adjusted you find yourself on the outskirts of Cairo. Glancing back at desert you frown. You feel something heavy in your pocket. You reach down and find a hefty amount of Gold and Silver along with a note: 

 Child of Man, may your life be filled with blessings.

Main hall
The main hall is a wonderous location, the walls rich with dozens of hieroglyphs as well as various pictures of the King and Queen as they adorn the walls. It shows their triumphs as they ruled their kingdom with a strange artifact in hand. It is a large jewel with gold decorations. It looks very important. A foutain of glittering water lies in the center of the room.

You can see a Queen&apos;s Door, a King&apos;s Door, an Ornate Door, and a Stone Door here.

You marvel at the scenery that is displayed before you. You somehow managed to find an Ancient Egyptian Tomb in the middle of nowhere! Since you cannot leave, you might as well explore the area. Those walls look interesting. 

That is before your flashlight sputters and dies. You shake it before you realize that it is really dead before throwing it away in disgust. Thankfully you lit the torch before you came in so you have some lighting.

 &quot;I warned you to leave.&quot; the voice growls again. It is then that you realize that the voice is coming from the Jackal! 
 &quot;Why are you still here?&quot; he asks menacingly, slowly getting closer to you. Maybe you should try talk to him…‮桔牥⁥獩愠漠湲瑡⁥潤牯琠⁯桴⁥潮瑲⁨湡⁤桴⁥慍湩栠

    <result xml:space="preserve">The wall slides open, revealing a hidden passageway. The Jackal quickly descends into the dark tunnel as you follow after him. When you finally reach the end, you find yourself back into the Main Hall as the passageway closes behind you. 

 The Jackal nods towards the entrance to the King&apos;s door. &quot;All that is left is to lock them in the room. There is not that many things of value in there, thankfully. I managed to take the mirror with me before I left.&quot;

Main hall
The main hall is a wonderous location, the walls rich with dozens of hieroglyphs as well as various pictures of the King and Queen as they adorn the walls. It shows their triumphs as they ruled their kingdom with a strange artifact in hand. It is a large jewel with gold decorations. It looks very important. A foutain of glittering water lies in the center of the room.

You can see a Queen&apos;s Door, a King&apos;s Door, and an Ornate Door here.

Treasury
A room filled with various treasures. All of Egypt&apos;s wealth is here. In the center of the room is a bejeweled pedestal with a diamond set in gold, silver, and lapis-lazuli. It glows with a mysterious power.

 &quot;Behold.&quot; the Jackal states, &quot;The Eye of Horus, the greatest treasure in all of Egypt.&quot;

On Jeweled Stand is Eye of Horus.

You may finally leave this place.&quot; he nods at you before he walks into the shadows. &quot;Farewell, and may we meet again.&quot; In a flash of light you find yourself out of the tomb and back in the desert. You flinch at the bright sunlight and when your eyes have adjusted you find yourself on the outskirts of Cairo. Glancing back at desert you frown. You feel something heavy in your pocket. You reach down and find a hefty amount of Gold and Silver along with a note: 

 Child of Man, may your life be filled with blessings.

Main hall
The main hall is a wonderous location, the walls rich with dozens of hieroglyphs as well as various pictures of the King and Queen as they adorn the walls. It shows their triumphs as they ruled their kingdom with a strange artifact in hand. It is a large jewel with gold decorations. It looks very important.

You can see a Queen&apos;s Door, a King&apos;s Door, and a Large Black Jackal here.
