Desert
The sands of the desert irritates your eyes as you look around. The entire desert is silent, and the only thing you can hear are your own heat-beat and the sound of your own breathing. It&apos;s freezing cold right now since blazing desert sun has set beyond the horizon. The Pyramid that holds the legendary Eye of Horus is stands before you, glowing with an eerie light.

You marvel at the scenery that is displayed before you. You somehow managed to find an Ancient Egyptian Tomb in the middle of nowhere! Since you cannot leave, you might as well explore the area. Those walls look interesting. 

That is before your flashlight sputters and dies. You shake it before you realize that it is really dead before throwing it away in disgust. Thankfully you lit the torch before you came in so you have some lighting.

The hallway is covered in dozens of various depictions of Ancient Egyptian art depicing the life of the Pharoah and his Queen. It is slightly stuffy here, no doubt due the amount of time that this tomb has been sealed away.
