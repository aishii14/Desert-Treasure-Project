READ ME (Desert Treasure)

Desert Treasure is a fairly complex story told in Inform 7. The plot involves the player entering a mysterious tomb in an attempt to seek shelter from a horrific sand-storm. Once there, he has to find a way to leave. With the help of the Tomb's Guardian the Player can either claim the Eye of Horus and use it to escape or through his action, become something greater. 

There are many puzzles in the game, some of them are kind of difficult but the solutions are usually obvious. 

1) When you start the game you end up in a dark room. You can't see anything and you're supposed to use your flashlight to illuminate the room. However, you're supposed to pick up the torch and light it with your matches because the moment you enter the next room, the flashlight will die, leaving you with only your torch for lighting. To open the door to the next room, you will need to pick up the key on the floor as well as the torch. But it's pretty obvious that you need to pick up the torch.

2) To open the door to the Hall of the sun you need to light the lanterns on the walls to open the door. When you get inside the Hall of the Sun, you need to put the silver mirror (acquired from the Hall of the Moon's door) into the pedestal to open the door to the King's chamber. 

3) To lock the thieves in the hall of the sun, you need to close and lock the King's, which involves putting out the lanterns that you lit earlier to open the door in the first place. 

I had a total of three beta testers. Justin Kunimune, Nik, and my mom. Here are their notes:

Justin:
Actually lock final door (otherwise error in the coding that was fixed)
Make it more obvious to use the flashlight (lock the first door in order for them to make them stay. Added prompts and hints to description of the door.)
Amulet in chamber's description even after taken. (fixed that by adding if clause)
Strike match (added action into coding)
Take all (disabled)
Make it more obvious for player to look into inventory (added descriptions and prompts)

Nik:
Fountain and kingdom misspelled (fixed)
silver door description (made description more unique)
Light lanterns error (otherwise statement error fixed)
pry mirror (added action into coding)
x pictures and symbols (added backdrop into game)
x ceiling/sunlight (added that in)

Mom:
Dozens of grammar error and spelling (fixed!)
Formatting parts (made it neat and clean with line breaks)
thief door locking part a bit too hard (added hints and prompts into description)
Added description of directions of things into main hall
Insert into door (made 'understand' coding)

I added some hints about the game in the descriptions as you interacted with the environment. This was mainly to help the player out without making them feel too frustrated or making them feel like they cheated by asking for hints. It's rather hard to visualize problems through a medium such as Text Games so I added observations into the game that would allow it to be easier. The secret ending is sort of the "Good-Good" ending which only triggers if you ask the Guardian a simple question. It's not too tricky but it's something people would typically ask a human of rather than an animal. I also added in so that you didn't need to reset in order to win. Entering the room with robbers in it is something only an idiot would do. So I acted accordingly and made the game safe by removing pit-falls like that. The affection system is sort of a secret value system that people can check out. Explorers would probably find it first since you would want to know more about the only NPC in the room while others would just focus on the getting to the end of the game. I rewarded players that got to the secret ending with an awesome ending as well. 

One particularly difficult challenge that I had was how to open the Golden door. Originally you had to rotate the pedestal so the mirror would redirect the sunlight into the door's gem. However, no matter how hard I tried it just didn't work. Eventually after I sent it over to Mr. Kiang for a solution, I eventually had to cut it out. Now all you had to do was to put the mirror into the pedestal and the door would open. However, by doing so I allowed me to focus on everything else and use the time that I might have spent trying to fix it to enhance other aspects of the game. 

I ended up beta-testing Justin's and Nik's game. Both of them were very interesting but I didn't finish either of their games. I wish I could have though! Mainly I gave descriptions about how to clarify points in their game was well as to make their games less disjointed and a more comfortable and enjoyable experience. I changed around wording, sentences, and I suggested hints or possible ways to make the puzzles easier. When they tested mine, it allowed me to gauge and determine what things I was missing, which allowed me to edit and adjust my game to make it as good as possible. It was a very beneficial experience. 

I made the game very immersive and tried to catalogue everything that a player might try. I didn't make it easy though, since I wanted a player to feel satisfaction at solving the puzzles. 

Overall, I think that I did pretty well with this game. I created a story that I wanted to tell and made it into something that you could interact and submerse yourself into. I'm very proud of everything that I have done and it would be a lie to say I like one thing about the game more than the other. I just loved making it from beginning to end. I did everything that I could to the best of my abilities, there's nothing that I would have done differently since I tried my absolute best to create a wonderful game.
